# Python-Paycheque-Tracker
A software application to track your hours worked easier.
I was inspired to create this project after I noticed an inconsistency with the amount of hours I worked and the pay I received. I began to track my hours by hand which was a tedious process and something I would not feel like doing after coming home from a long shift. As a result I made this simple python project which is conveniently stored on my desktop. With a click of a button and a few inputs, I can keep track of my hours after each shift and feel confident due to the computer's precision. Additionally, I was able to use some libraries which exposed me to the intersection of python programming and Microsoft excel. This may prove to be beneficial in the future if I pursue a career in finance. 
I only got to play around with GUI on python which allowed me to bring out my creative side.
